    <h2>Novels</h2>
    <p>A novel is a long prose narrative that usually<br>
         describes fictional characters and events in the form of a sequential story.<br>
          It rests on the consensus that the novel is today the longest genre of narrative prose,<br>
           followed by the novella, novelette and the short story.<br>
            However, there is no consensus as to the minimal required lenght. In part because of this wide variation,<br>
             the boundary between a novella and a novel may be arbitrary and difficult to determine.<br>

        The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America specifies a word length of over 40,000 words for a novel,<br>
         while National Novel Writing Month requires its novels to be at least 50,000 words.</p>
